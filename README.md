To-Do Together is a simple, shared to-do list which you can use to share your schedules with your friends in a fast and easy way.

This web application was built as a part of NYU Abu Dhabi's CADT-UH 1013EQ 2023 Spring 001-2 | Language of Computers course. 

The web application uses Vanilla JS and Bootstrap for the front-end, and Node.js and Express for the back-end. MongoDB is currently used for the database. The web application is [deployed](https://loc-final-project.onrender.com/) on [Render](https://render.com/).
